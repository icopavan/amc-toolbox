amc-toolbox is a MATLAB toolbox for automatic modulation classification. A companion toolbox for Automatic Modulation Classification: Principles, Algorithms and Applications. For more details, please visit: http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118906497.html.

Initially, along with the launch of the book in February 2014, we are releasing the some building blocks for testing and developing modulation classification algorithms. The first batch of codes will include signal generation, channel simulation, pre-processing, extraction of high order statistics features. The classifiers available are maximum likelihood classifiers, k-nearest neighbour classifiers, and genetic programming classifiers.

Additional features and complete documentations will be added in the future.
